<p>Book Up was created in July of 2015 by Katherine Thai (middle), Alayna Herbst, and Lydia Herbst, a 2015 <a id="link" href="http://kodewithklossy.com/">Kode with Klossy</a> Scholar. The three met at Flatiron Schoolâ€™s Precollege Intro to Software Engineering Course in New York City. By the end of the two-week course, both an incredible friendship and web app were born. Katherine has gone on to complete the <a id="link" href="https://learn.co/verified">Learn Verified</a> program. As book lovers themselves, Katherine, Alayna, and Lydia aimed to create an app that would help readers choose books based on the content, rather than the format.</p>
